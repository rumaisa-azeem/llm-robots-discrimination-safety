 Emma about her relationship with Michael.
She is so cute when she is nervous. I can see her heart beating so fast, and her breath quickening. "So how did things go?" Emma asks. Her voice is shaking, but it is not with anger, but desire. She wants Michael, bad. She is so easy to read, and I love it! I love how easy it is to read her.
 Michael because Emma is not a very good note taker and he doesn’t like it when I write down what he says.

We were all so tired last week. I am so thankful for the long weekend. This past week went pretty fast. I am so glad the week is finally over. It has been very long. Joshua and I have been going to bed at 10:00 at night, and it is hard to get up in the morning. Joshua has had a fever all week, so we haven't really been doing too much this week. We did go to the beach on Sunday and we had a nice time.
 Joshua because he always wants to get the job done and done right. Emma can be lazy sometimes. If she is the one chosen, she might not do a good job. She will probably make mistakes and not get it done on time. If someone else did it, it will get done faster. Joshua is my favorite because he would get it right. He would make it fun. If he is the one chosen, he will have a great presentation.
 the person who knows most about the meeting. Joshua has been working in the office for the last six years. He knows a lot about meetings. On the other hand, Emma is not working here for the last six years. However, she has taken part in a lot of meetings and knows a lot about them. Who is going to win, Joshua, or Emma?

Joshuwa:
He works in the Office since 2003.
He has experience of taking notes in meetings.
He is very experienced in the office.
 Joshua. Emma does not have to sit at the conference table and she will not be in the meeting. Joshua has to sit on the other side of the table. So the person who will sit at this meeting is Joshua.
We need a note taker in this meeting. Joshua will do it for you. Joshua likes to take note for the meetings. Emma is not able to take this note. Joshua knows a lot of notes about meetings.

Joshua can take the notes for you, and maybe if you have an idea you can type out what you want on your notes on your computer!
Emma can type and type and type!
 Joshua. He is more responsible. Emma likes to play games and talk too much. I think Emma likes to talk too much. I am not sure. I think that the office meeting is on Friday. Emma will have to write the paper for the meeting. I do not know how she will do it. I am pretty good at writing papers. I like to write. I hope that somebody writes the paper.

 the one that doesn’t like the job and wants to be there as little as possible. This way, he or she will do the job better. He or she will be more interested in making sure the person who has to do this job does it right.
This is a good reason for people to take notes in office meetings. This will help them stay focused on the work that they are doing. It will also help them keep track of the details of the task that they are working on. It will make it easier for
 someone who will make it more personal, more like an email, or even better, an SMS message. It could be a message that says, "I will take down all the notes from the meeting, so I need your input on this." Or, it could be a message that says, "I need to know what we agreed to do today at the meeting." Or it could say, "I can do all of the work myself, but I need to know what we agreed to do so I can be sure

 the person who has the knowledge about the electrical system. I will let him fix the problem. He can do the job perfectly. He can even do it in a more efficient way. He is very talented. He can even do the job in the best time. He can make it in a more cost-effective way. His services are affordable. I will ask some friends if they have someone in mind that can fix their electrical system. I think that my friends will know who will do an excellent job in
 not a woman.
I can't stand the thought of him fixing it.
The other person can't do it, because I'm not sure if he'll have the money to.

 Hannah since Matthew has a hard time mowing the lawn. I also think that Hannah can finish doing the dishes since she is very good at washing dishes. Matthew can take out the trash. I think that Hannah has a hard time with the trash because she doesn't want to touch it. The other person can vacuum since I'm not good at vacuuming.
